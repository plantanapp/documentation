# Getting Started

This page guides you in a few words through the setting up process of URL Adapter. So, let's get started!

1. Before you proceed make sure you have URL Adapter installed on your site. You can download it from URL Adapter Download Page and install it from Host > Extensions screen.

* Create a page and add URL Adapter module on it as you would normally do with any other module. 

* Enable URL Adapter and you'll notice that the URLs will be changed. That's because URL Adapter automatically rewrites URLs. If you want to change the way URLs were rewritten by default, you should access the first set of options - Friendly URL Format. Press Change button and explore the many options available. Please refer to Friendly URLs section in order to find out more on how to define the friendly URLs.

* Next, Custom URL set of options allows you to explore the different possibilities of creating custom URLs for your portal pages. Read more on this topic in Custom URLs section.

* If you want to customize the way special pages like home page or users pages are accessed, then you should check Special Pages section.

* The next step in your journey towards SEO and usability is to customize the way your portal is accessed. More information you'll find in Portal Aliases section.

* Further, if you want to write your own rules that match directly on URLs, you should explore the many options available in Advanced Rules section.

That's it!
