# Neverbounce email verification - action

The action is available in:
* Action Form
* Action Grid
* API Endpoint
* Sharp Scheduler

and works only if the [Setup Neverbounce action](add-ons\email-verification\features\setup-neverbounce-email-verification-action.html) was used at least once on the instance.

It takes an email address as input and will output the result received from the Neverbounce API in a token, which name you specify in the *Output Result TokenName* field.
