# Installation

Install the add-on from Host &gt; Extensions just as you would with any other extension. 
Then you should be able to use either of the Neverbounce Email Verification Add-on features:
* [Neverbounce Email Validation custom validator](features/neverbounce-email-validation-custom-validator.html) that can be added on a field(textbox) in Action Form
* [Neverbounce Email Verification action](features/neverbounce-email-verification-action.html) that can be used in Action Form, Action Grid, API Endpoint, Sharp Scheduler

Before using any of the actions above make sure you run in the same module (eg. on Form's init) the [Setup Neverbounce Email Verification](features/setup-neverbounce-email-verification-action.html) action; the action is used to set the API username and api key needed for connecting to the Neverbounce Service.
