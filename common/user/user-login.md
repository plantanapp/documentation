# User Login

Action Grid allows you to require the user to be logged in to view and edit the grid. You also can use this action on a grid button to log in a user when clicks on the button - this is a simple form with username and password fields. Note that the form must contain the Username and Password fields so the User Login action applied to the button to work.
