# Code Actions {#code}

Code actions will allow you to execute pieces of code\(SQL, RazorScript,...\) and bring new data to your thread of action by using one of the following actions:

* **Apply Tokens**
* **Execute Javascript**
* **Execute Token**

Both **Apply Tokens **and** Execute Token **are used to bring new data needed for the actions that follow and their functionality is similar to the **Inject Form Data** action
