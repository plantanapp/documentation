# Introduction - SharpCDN

SharpCDN is the first and only module for DNN platform that will drastically increase the website's speed using the power of a worldwide CDN.<br>
SharpCDN is powered by the amazingly fast Amazon CloudFront network services, with datacenters located worldwide.

Here's some of the key benefits of our SharpCDN:
* **Powered by Amazon CloudFront**. CloudFront is the most powerful and popular CDN for serving static content;
* **Increased Server Performance**. The CDN frees the web server from delivering static files, increasing performance by up to 60%;
* **Realtime CDN Refresh**. As soon as your website files change, Sharp CDN knows to propage them instantly across the globe;
* **Minify CSS and JavaScript files**. Sharp CDN can automatically minify CSS and JavaScript files to save bandwidth;
* **Exclude files from minification**. Some JavaScript files do not handle minification well so they should be excluded from minification;
* **Exclude bots and custom domains**. This gives you to ability to load files locally when website is accesed by a bot or crawler;
* **Compress JPEG images**. Sharp CDN can better compress JPEG images to save bandwidth;
* **Fallback to Local Files**. If CDN goes down (which should never happen) or your quota is exceeded, Sharp CDN falls back to serve the files as before from local server;
* **Free Tier**. Sharp CDN is free for everybody to use for up to 500 page views per month.
