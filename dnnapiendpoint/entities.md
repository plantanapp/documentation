# Entities

## Summary

* Entities are objects, or list of objects, that you can load into context
* If there's only one entity in the context, you don't need entities
* Some actions operate with entities
* Roadmap: We plan that all actions will accept executing in the context of entities (so for example, a Send Email will execute for each Lead entity)
