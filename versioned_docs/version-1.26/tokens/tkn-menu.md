# Tokens menu

The main page of the `Tokens` section allows you to:

* [See a list of all the ](#core-tokens)<em>[Core Tokens](#core-tokens)</em>, along with their accepted `Values`, general `Usage` and usage `Examples` (where applicable); see also the **`Core Tokens`** page of this section for details.
* [Create new namespace contexts for your tokens](#namespaces-and-custom-tokens).
* See your <em>Custom Tokens</em>, by namespace.
* [Export/import tokens](#export-and-import-tokens) (as JSON).
* Alter the [Security and Debugging settings](#settings-security-and-debugging) for your tokens.
* [Test your tokens](#test-tokens-feature) to see what values they return.

## `Core Tokens`

The full list of available Core Tokens in Plant an App is displayed by clicking the `Core Tokens` button; this will expand the list.

Alternatively, you can expand/collapse the list by clicking the "`Expand All`" / "`Collapse All`" buttons in the bottom part of the section.

<img src="/img/core_tkn2.png" alt="core_tkn2.png"></img>

Selecting a specific Core Token from the list will provide details about it on the main part of the screen - namely, a short description, the values it accepts, its typical usage and a few examples (where relevant).

For a general detailed list of the available Core Tokens in Plant an App, please see the "<a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/tokens/tkn-core" target="_blank">Core Tokens</a>" page.

Note that clicking a specific token from the list will open a dedicated associated tab on the main screen. This will happen for every different namespace you select from the list. You can then easily navigate between the tabs and close them separately by clicking the "<strong>X</strong>" button.

## Namespaces and custom tokens

Other than core tokens, Plant an App allows you to create customized tokens and group them into specific, custom namespaces. We have a complete documentation section about this specific topic - please see the "<a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/tokens/custom-tokens-and-namespaces" target="_blank">Custom Tokens and Namespaces</a>" page.

## Export and import tokens

Allows you to export and import tokens as a JSON.

### **Export token**

1. Click the `Export tokens` button.<br />
<img src="/img/tkn_exp1.png" alt="tkn_exp1.png"></img><br />
2. Check the box(es) next to the token(s) you want to export.<br />

<img src="/img/tkn_exp2.png" alt="tkn_exp2.png"></img><br />
Note that you can select individual tokens from a namespace, or the namespace as a whole - in which case all the tokens in the given namespace will be exported. In the example above, a specific token from one namespace is selected for export (<em>MyToken2</em>), as well a namespace (<em>Namespace2</em>) in full. Notice the different type of selection icons. You also have the `Select All` and `Deselect All` buttons to help you with multiple, large selections.

3. Click the `Export` button. You will be presented with your tokens selected for export as a JSON. You can then click the `Copy` button and subsequently paste the selection to a file or field.

Once finished, simply click the `Cancel` button or anywhere outside the export window to automatically close it.

### **Import token**

1. Click the `Import tokens` button.

<img src="/img/tkn_imp1.png" alt="tkn_imp1.png"></img>

2. Paste the token(s)/namespace(s) you want to import, as a JSON, in the field that is presented and click `Import`.

<img src="/img/tkn_imp2.png" alt="tkn_imp2.png"></img>

3. A message confirming the success of the import process should be displayed in the lower right corner of your window.

<img src="/img/tkn_imp3.png" alt="tkn_imp3.png"></img>

Note that the import field contains an automatic validator that will detect any syntax problems that would prevent the proper interpretation (and thus the import) of your token(s) or namespace(s). The line(s) where a syntax problem is detected are marked accordingly and a tooltip will give you a brief explanation of the issue. See an example below:

<img src="/img/tkn_imp4.png" alt="tkn_imp4.png"></img>

### `Settings` (Security and Debugging)

In this section you can change settings related to the security aspects of your tokens, as well as activating debug features that allow detailed information logging. The Settings are accessible by clicking the "cog" button:

<img src="/img/tkn_sett.png" alt="tkn_sett.png"></img>

### `Security`

You can access the security settings of your tokens by expanding the "Security" section of the **General Settings** window. This will give you access to two toggle-based settings:

<img src="/img/tkn_security.png" alt="tkn_security.png"></img>

* Toggle the "<strong>Allow inline script access</strong>" slider to the right to enable the creation of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-6.0">Razor tokens</a> on the fly, directly inside the content (for example, in the content of HTML modules).

In order to be recognized as such, the inline scripts should be placed between tags:

```
<code data-language="razor">...</code>
```

Please <a href="https://docs.dnnsharp.com/my-tokens/scripts/razor-examples.html">see here</a> for a few examples.

:::caution

Enable this option only if the users accessing the configuration screens where tokens can be used are trusted.

:::

* Toggle the "<strong>Allow [AppSettings:\*] tokens</strong>" slider to the right to allow the access of the app settings from the IIS <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/web-config?view=aspnetcore-6.0">`web.config`</a> file through `[AppSettings:<key>]` type tokens.

<img src="/img/tkn_security2.png" alt="tkn_security2.png"></img>

:::caution

While activating this feature can be useful for easy access to global settings, be aware that application settings can contain sensitive information such as encryption keys.

Make sure that you only enable this option if the users accessing the configuration screens where tokens can be used are trusted.

:::

:::note

You will need to click the `Save` button (lower right corner of the **General Settings** window) for the changes to take effect.

:::

### `Debugging`

You can expand the token debugging feature by clicking on the "Debugging" section of the **General Settings** window.

<img src="/img/tkn_debug.png" alt="tkn_debug.png"></img>

Toggle the slider (1) to the right to activate the token debugging feature and to the left to deactivate it.

You can filter the debug option by adding specific IP addresses to the debugging list (2). In this case, debugging information will only be logged if access by a user whose IP address is in the list is detected. Insert only one IP address per line.

You can add your present IP address to the list above in one click by using the `Append my current IP` button (3).

:::note

You will need to click the `Save` button (lower right corner of the **General Settings** window) for the changes to take effect.

:::

### `Test Tokens` feature

Found in the lower part of the main page, this feature allows you to test your tokens and check their output on-the-spot. You can expand it either from the `Edit token` screen (via the "`Save & Test`" button), or by clicking the "`<> Test Tokens`" bar in the bottom of the main page.
