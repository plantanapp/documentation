### Special Notes

The `DateTime:Now` token will give varying outputs depending on both user context and the site settings.

1. If a user context is given: This output will be adjusted to the User Profile's Preferred Time Zone.
<br/>
    This situation occurs (1) when there is a logged-in user, or (2) when actions are being executed and the Load User action has been implemented to modify the context to a different user.
2. If no user context is given: The output aligns with the Settings / Site Settings / Site Time Zone.
<br/>
    For instance, this case would be valid when you establish an automation job that doesn't have a defined context user, and there's no load user action being implemented.
