In Plant an App, Automations are executed as ***Jobs***, which contain ***Triggers*** and ***Actions***. A Trigger is an event that will start executing all the Actions assigned to the Job. As such, a Job is a combination of Triggers and Actions.

The main page of the `Jobs` section allows you to create a new automation job from scratch or import and edit an already exported one.

- **`NEW JOB`** 
Opens the job creation page.

- **`IMPORT`** 
Will open a pop-up "Import Job" editor that will allow you to paste and edit an already existing job in a JSON format. Within the editor, you can choose to overwrite an existing Job with the same name.

:::info

If you do not check the **`Overwrite`** box, the job will be imported with the "`_Copy`" suffix concatenated to its name.<br />
If the box is checked, the job will be imported as such and will replace any pre-existing job with the same name.

:::

The same main page shows your full Jobs list and allows you to `Run`, `Edit` and `Disable` them.

The *Additional options* button enable you to `Clone`, `Export` (as JSON file), and `Delete` each Job, as well as checking its execution `History` (see the job "`History`" page of this section).

Clicking the Job name will expand its view and provide you details about its last execution (and if it was successful), when the next run is scheduled and how many `Triggers` and `Actions` it contains.

## New Job configuration

### `1. Settings`

Main configuration fields for each Job.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
|*Name*|Mandatory; please choose a unique name for every job in order to uniquely identify it.|
|*Context Portal*|Defaults to the current portal; this settings affects the result of the `[Portal:*]` tokens.|
|*Context User*|Optional; this settings affects the result of the `[User:*]` tokens as well as actions such as `Send Mail` and `Grant Role` (see below).|
|*Debug Mode*|Checking this box allows you to get more information in the Job History section.|

:::tip

Other than the *Context User* field, additional users can be added later from the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/actions/load-user" target="_blank">**Context > Load User**</a> action.

### `2. Triggers`

In this section you can define one or more triggers that will cause the Job to execute. 

#### `UI Controls`

<img src="/img/trigger_control.png" alt="trigger_control.png"></img>

- To create a new Trigger, click the `Add Trigger` button ①.
- Expand/collapse a Trigger configuration section by clicking on its tile bar ②.
- Alternatively, click the `Expand All` button ③ to expand all Triggers' config sections .
- Disable/Enable a Trigger by clicking the "Power" button ④.
- Use the "Options" button ⑤ to either *Delete* or *Clone* a Trigger.

:::note

You need to click the `Save` button in the upper-right corner of the screen for changes (configuration changes, deletions, etc.) to take effect.

:::

:::tip

You can create as many Triggers as you want, but they will be parsed in the order they were created/they are displayed.

:::

#### `Types`
There are four types of Triggers you can define in Plant an App:
- `App Events` - triggers activated by application events and states
- `Database` - triggers activated by Database actions (such as *insert*, *delete*, *update*)
- `Time` - time based triggers
- `Users` - user-related triggers (creation, login, etc.) 

For detailed information about the Triggers types, configuration and use, please see the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/next/automation/automation-jobs-triggers" target="_blank">Job Triggers</a> page of this section.


### `3. Actions`
Here you can define the Actions that will be executed when a Trigger fires.

#### `UI Controls`
<img src="/img/jobs_actions_controls.png" alt="jobs_actions_controls.png"></img>

- To create a new Action, click the `Add Action` button ①. Note that its name is editable.
- Import an Action (JSON format) by clicking the `Import Action` button ②.
- Expand/collapse an Action configuration section by clicking on its tile bar ③.
- Alternatively, click the `Expand All` button ④ to expand all Actions' config sections .
- The "Edit Condition" button ⑤ is used to determine if this action will execute (Boolean expression). Use it to enable or disable actions programmatically. For example, enabling a *ShowError* action only makes sense if an error is found. This field supports Tokens.
- Disable/Enable a Trigger by clicking the "Power" button ⑥.
- The `Copy` button ⑦ allows you to copy the Action as a JSON file. You will then be able to paste and edit it in the `Import Action` section for example.
- Use the "Options" button ⑧ to either *Delete*, *Export* (as JSON) or *Clone* an Action.

For detailed information about the Action types, configuration and use, please see the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/faq" target="_blank">**`Actions`** documentation section page</a>.

:::note

You need to click the `Save` button in the upper-right corner of the screen for changes (configuration changes, deletions, etc.) to take effect.

:::tip

You can create as many Actions as you want and you can modify their order by drag-and-drop.

### `4. On Error`
The Actions defined in this section will execute when the current job encounters an error. Specifically for this context, the following tokens are available to help you identify:
- The action that failed: [`ActionId`], [`ActionName`], [`ActionDescription`]
- The error itself: [`ErrorType`], [`ErrorMessage`], [`StackTrace`]

#### `UI Controls`
<img src="/img/action_error_controls.png" alt="action_error_controls.png"></img>

- To create a new Error Action, click the `Add Action` button ①. Note that its name is editable.
- Import an Action (JSON format) by clicking the `Import Action` button ②.
- Expand/collapse an Action configuration section by clicking on its tile bar ③.
- Alternatively, click the `Expand All` button ④ to expand all Actions' config sections.
- The "Edit Condition" button ⑤ is used to determine if this action will execute (Boolean expression). Use it to enable or disable actions programmatically. For example, enabling a *ShowError* action only makes sense if an error is found. This field supports Tokens.
- Disable/Enable a Trigger by clicking the "Power" button ⑥.
- The `Copy` button ⑦ allows you to copy the Action as a JSON file. You will then be able to paste and edit it in the `Import Action` section for example.
- Use the "Options" button ⑧ to either *Delete*, *Export* (as JSON) or *Clone* an Action.
