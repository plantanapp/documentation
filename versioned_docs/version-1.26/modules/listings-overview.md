## What is `Listings`?

The **Listings** module enables you to integrate powerful data tables populated from multiple sources into your Plant an App pages. The data is displayed in a table format, providing a simple, yet flexible overview mechanism.

This table-style displays data in an ergonomic and responsive form marked by headers that allows for easy data viewing and readily-accessible manipulation mechanisms: sorting, filtering, searching and much more.

Below are some of `Listing`s' main features that will also provide you with insights as to where and how you could use it when building your App.

### Forms integration

**Listings** is seamlessly integrated with the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/category/form" target="_blank">**Forms**</a> module. You can manage submitted entries from multiple forms which can be filtered, sorted, edited, searched or deleted.

### Data management from any Source

Listings has out-of-the-box data fetch models for most common data sources you might want to use in your App: forms created with the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/modules/forms-main-menu-and-usage" target="_blank">Form Builder</a>, **database tables**, **SQL queries**, **server requests** (in JSON format) and **credential stores entries**. Other than those standard models, **custom datasources** can be also easily integrated for display.

### Responsive and Touchscreen friendly

Data displayed by Listings can easily be navigated via a touch interface. The data grids generated in Listings can fit into any screen size, resolution and are swipe-ready on touch capable devices.
