This type of field allows you to define a file uploader in your Form and finetune its usage. There are three types of `Files` fields:

- [`File Manager`](#file-manager) (interface for managing attached files)
- [`Single File Uploader`](#single-file-upload) (allows a single file upload)
- [`Multi File Uploader`](#multi-file-upload) (allows multiple files upload)

Note that only the field-specific parameters will be listed below. Please <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/modules/fields-overview-and-settings#common-parameters" target="_blank">see here</a> for a list of **common parameters** to all fields and <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/modules/fields-overview-and-settings#common-configuration-sections-bind-expressions-ui-settings-validation" target="_blank">here</a> for the **common configuration** elements to all fields.

## File manager

This field gives you the ability to browse files from the Plant an App File Manager, as well as uploading new files to the selected folder via its too tabs: `Upload` and `Browse Files`. It supports *Single* and *Multiple* file uploads (see parameters below). The files retrieved from the server can be filtered by their extension. If this is used to upload images, they can be resized in the browser before being uploading them to the server. This way you can save bandwidth and speed-up the upload process. This field can also be used as a "helper field" when the "*`Display in Popup`*" option (see below) is enabled. You can both upload files and select existing files, and when the modal is committed, you will have access to the selected files and the files in the upload queue using the Callback setting.

*How to Get the File Size for an Uploaded file?*

If you want to display a message which informs the form user about the details of the uploaded file, you can use some of the predefined tokens:

1. On your form add a `Single File Upload` field, set the title to "*Upload*", set an upload location and optionally a file size limit;
2. Add a button with a "`Display Message`" type action (see the **`Buttons`** and <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/faq" target="_blank">**`Actions`**</a> pages respectively), and fill in the following tokens in the *Message box*:

- extension: `[Upload:FileExtension]`
- size: `[Upload:FileSize]` and size expressed in units:`[Upload:FileSizeB]`B,`[Upload:FileSizeKB]` KB, `[Upload:FileSizeMB]` MB, `[Upload:FileSizeGB]` GB
- mime type `[Upload:MimeType]`

Where `[Upload]` is the title of the Single File Upload field.
