Note that only the field-specific parameters will be listed below. Please <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/modules/fields-overview-and-settings#common-parameters" target="_blank">see here</a> for a list of **common parameters** to all fields and <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/modules/fields-overview-and-settings#common-configuration-sections-bind-expressions-ui-settings-validation" target="_blank">here</a> for the **common configuration** elements to all fields.

## CAPTCHA

Allows you to add a [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) (*Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart*) verification code to your form.

- Specific Parameters:

| Field | Description and information |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
|*Display on One Line* |Checkbox; if active, the CAPTCHA control will display the image and the input box on same line.|
|*Show Refresh Button* |Checkbox; if active, displays a refresh button that allows the user to refresh the CAPTCHA image. Each refresh triggers a server request to get a new image and encryption key.|
| *Save to Report* | Checking this box automatically saves the value from this Field into the database, under the `avtActionForm_Reports` table. |

## Device Fingerprint

A device fingerprint is a unique code that is generated by using different methods in order to uniquely identify the digital signature of a device when it is using a website. You can use this field if you want a extra layer of security for your device.

- Specific Parameters:

| Field | Description and information |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
|*Fingerprint Options*|By default, all the options are activated and you can exclude one or more if you want to get less information from the device. More information about each option can be found [here](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs).|
| *Save to Report* | Checking this box automatically saves the value from this Field into the database, under the `avtActionForm_Reports` table. |

## Password

This field allows to re/set a password.

- Specific Parameters:

| Field | Description and information |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
|*Initial Value*|Define the initial value with which the field will be loaded; it can be the old password or a default password for example.|
|*Confirmation Of*|You can use two "Password" fields in order to confirm a set password. This parameter will automatically compare the two. Simply choose the field to compare against from the drop-down list.|
|*Display Show/Hide Password Control*|Checking this option allows the form user to see the password in clear txt by clicking a button - "`üëÅ`".|
| *Save to Report* | Checking this box automatically saves the value from this Field into the database, under the `avtActionForm_Reports` table. |

## Permission Grid

Allows you to define custom, Form-specific roles and permissions.

- Specific Parameters:

| Field | Description and information |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
|*Roles*|Define one role name or ID per line. Special roles "All Users" and "Unauthenticated Users" are also supported. This field supports contextual tokens, such as `[RoleName]` and <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/tokens/custom-tokens-and-namespaces" target="_blank">Custom Tokens</a>.|
|*Permissions*|Define one permission name per line. Note that these Permissions do not need to be mapped to anything from the Plant an App site at this stage. The Permissions defined here are given a meaning later, depending on the context in which they are used.|
|*Load Permissions*|Allows you to load permissions from tokens. The first column (`Permission Key`) defines **VIEW**, **EDIT**, or other permission that you want to load. The second column (`Roles`) is a comma delimited list of role IDs or role names. It can also be permissions loaded with a LoadPage or LoadModule action. Supports contextual tokens such as `[Roles]` and <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/tokens/custom-tokens-and-namespaces" target="_blank">Custom Tokens</a>.|
| *Save to Report* | Checking this box automatically saves the value from this Field into the database, under the `avtActionForm_Reports` table. |


:::tip

How to quickly create a **Permission Grid** for your Form:

- Add a "**Permission Grid**" field
- Set the Roles (for example: `Registered Users`, `Subscribers`)
- Set the Permissions (for example: `View`, `Edit`)
- Set Load Permissions (for example: `View for Key`, `[ViewToken] for Roles`)
- Add a button with an <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/actions/update-page" target="_blank">"`Update Page`"</a> action and set similar permissions on the action, just like on the previous step.
