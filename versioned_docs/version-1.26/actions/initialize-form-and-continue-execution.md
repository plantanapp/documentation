This action allows you to manually trigger the initialization of a Form.

It is helpful in situations where you have multiple Form modules on the same page, and you set their **Display Mode** to **Manual**. This prevents the forms from loading and helps save bandwidth at page load (your page will load a lot faster) while allowing you to initialize them (wake them up) when they are needed.

:::note
The page will not be refreshed when a Form is initialized.
