| Bind Expression - Show | Dynamically show or hide this field. This must be a boolean expression. Use standard javascript boolean operators (==, !=, &#x3C;,&#x3E; , !). For example, use [PaymentMethod] == &#x27;CreditCard&#x27; to show the credit card field only when the Payment Method is set accordingly. Supports Tokens. | No | None |
| Preserve Layout? | Check this box in order to make sure hiding/showing fields will not affect the layout of the form. | No | None |
| Bind Expression - Value | Dynamically compute the value of this field. So when other fields change this fields updates automatically. Use standard javascript operators where needed (+, -, *, /).

Supports Tokens. | No | None |
| Bind Expression - On Change/Click | Bind some javascript code to execute when the value in this field changes or when a button is clicked.

Supports Tokens. | No | None |
| Tokenize Bind Expressions? | Check this box in order to tokenize the Bind Expressions fields. This is useful when you dynamically compute the id values so you need to tokenize and obtain the real IDs first. | No | None |
| Field ID Token Name | Similarly to normal fields, the ID is the name/inputted id sanitized. This means that if you dynamically generate id's, they might contain spaces or other invalid characters. For this, we output the sanitized id of the field. Give a name to this token which holds the sanitized ID. | No | None |
