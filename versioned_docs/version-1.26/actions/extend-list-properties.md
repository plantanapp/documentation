This action extends an entity in the current context with new properties. 

## `Typical Use Cases`

- After creating a contextual entity with any of the load entity actions, use this action to add a property such as an ID before passing to the [Execute Actions for each List Entry ](/actions/execute-actions-for-each-list-entry.md) action.

## `Don't use it to`

- Create an entity. Use [Add List Entry](/actions/add-list-entry.md) or any of the `Create List from (Source)` actions instead (e.g. [Create List from CSV file (obsolete)](/actions/create-list-from-csv-file-obsolete.md)).
