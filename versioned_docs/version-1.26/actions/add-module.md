Can contain context tokens (for example [SomeTabId]) and My Tokens. | Yes | None |
| Module Type | Identifies the type of module to create. Select from list or use an expression that resolves to an extension name. Can contain context tokens (for example [SomeModuleType]) and My Tokens. | Yes | None |
| Module Title | Specify a title for the module. Leave empty if you don't want to update Page Name. Note that you can use a context token like [Title] to read it from input or use My Tokens. | Yes | None |
| Pane | The name of the pane where to place the new module. Note that you can use a context token like [PaneName] to read it from input or use My Tokens. | Yes | None |
| Display Container | This option will be evaluated as a boolean such as true. Note that you can use a context token like [DisplayContainer] to read it from input or use My Tokens. | Yes | None |

| Permissions | Set permissions for the module. The first column would contain VIEW or EDIT. The second is a list of role IDs or role names delimited by comma or semicolon.

| Store Module ID in | Specify a key for storing the ID of the newly created module. You can access it in other actions using the bracket syntax. For example, if you save under MyModuleId, you can get it later with [MyModuleId] token. Leave empty if you don't need the module ID. | No | None |
