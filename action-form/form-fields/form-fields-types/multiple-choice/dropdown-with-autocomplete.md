# Dropdown with Autocomplete

Enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.

The Dropdown with Autocomplete field provides suggestions while you type into the field. For example type "dn" for Dnn Sharp.

On submit, it generates a comma-delimited list of tags.

### Options:

* Datasource 
  * Choose from existing data sources or provide values into the Item List area; Input one item per line. If you need to provide different text and value, then separate them by pipe. Can contain [My Tokens](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/my-custom-tokens).
* Initially Selected
