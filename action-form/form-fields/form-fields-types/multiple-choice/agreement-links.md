# Agreement links

This is the field that will help you replace multiple Agree to Terms fields
![Multiple Agree to Terms](https://static.dnnsharp.com/documentation/multiple_agree_to_terms.png "Multiple Agree to Terms and Condition")
with one single field with multiple options
![Agree to Terms with multiple options](https://static.dnnsharp.com/documentation/agreement_links_field.png "Agree to Terms with multiple options")

It allows you to specify multiple parameters(links) for the same *Agree to...* field and they can be of different types:
* *html* - custom html that will be shown in the popup
* *page* - an existing page from your website that will be shown in the popup

More customizable options:
* word between links
* popup width and height
* popup close button (this is the "*I agree*" consent button shown on every popup)
* **enforce reading terms** (when checked, each terms popup will be opened one by one; the True value to the Agreement checkbox will be applied **only when** "*I agree*" is clicked on all of the popups)
