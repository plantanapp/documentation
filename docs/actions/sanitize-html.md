This action recieves HTML input and repairs broken HTML tag syntax, removes specifed HTML tags and attributes, sets the "rel" attribute to "nofollow" on anchor tags and removes scripts, based on the settings that are selected and set by the user.

## `Typical Use Cases`

- Apply to the input of a field in a form before the data is saved to your database.
- Apply to HTML recieved via an API before it is saved to your database.
- Apply to the content of an incoming email before the content is saved to your database.

## `Don't use it to`

- Sanitize multiple inputs at once. Use a separate action for each input.
- To prevent SQL injection. Use Bind Tokens in your [Run SQL Query](/docs/actions/run-sql) action instead.

## `Examples`

### `1. Remove Scripts and Common Mouse Event Attributes`

This example is set to remove scripts from HTML and some common mouse event attributes that could contain javascript. The list of attributes is not intended to be comprehensive, but suggests the type of attributes you could include.

```json

{
    "Title": "Sanitize Html",
    "ActionType": "Parsing.SanitizeHtml",
    "Description": "Example Sanitize HTML Action Import",
    "Condition": null,
    "Parameters": {
        "HtmlContent": "[YourInputToken]",
        "ForceAnchorNoFollow": false,
        "RemovableAttributes": [
            "onclick",
            "onmouseover",
            "onmouseout"
        ],
        "DisableScripts": true,
        "IsAllowedMode": false,
        "TagsList": [],
        "RemovableTags": [],
        "OutputTokenName": "[YourOutputToken]"
    }
}
â€‹
```

### `2. Restrict users ability to submit complex HTML`

This example also disables scripts. In addition it adds the "rel=nofollow" attribute to all links, restricts the user to a limited list of very basic HTML tags, and prevents them from using inline styles.

```json

{
    "Title": "Sanitize Html",
    "ActionType": "Parsing.SanitizeHtml",
    "Description": "Example Sanitize HTML Action Import",
    "Condition": null,
    "Parameters": {
        "HtmlContent": "[YourInputToken]",
        "ForceAnchorNoFollow": true,
        "RemovableAttributes": [
            "style"
        ],
        "DisableScripts": true,
        "IsAllowedMode": true,
        "TagsList": [
            "h2",
            "h3",
            "h4",
            "p",
            "hr",
            "a",
            "ul",
            "ol",
            "li",
            "span"
        ],
        "RemovableTags": [],
        "OutputTokenName": "[YourOutputToken]"
    }
}

```
