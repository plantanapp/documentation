This action creates an entity list in the current context from the content of a provided XLSX file. You can find the number of loaded entities in the `[<entityname>:Count]` token.

:::note
This creates an entity that can be used ONLY in the current context. This does not create a [Plant an App Entity](/docs/entities).

## `Typical Use Cases`

- Load values from an Excel file provided by a user in a File Upload form field and then use Execute Actions on Entity List to run the same actions on each item in the uploaded file.
- Use in **`Automation`** to Load values from an Excel file already on the server and then use Execute Actions on Entity List to run the same actions on each item in the file.

## `Don't use it to`

- Take actions on the provided Excel file such as renaming it. Use File Management actions instead.
- Serialize data to create an Excel file. Use the `Serialize to Excel from entity list XLSX` action instead.

| Include All Fields | Select this option to include all columns in the provided Excel file. | No | `false` | No |

| Properties | Map columns from the Excel file to properties of the entity. | Yes | None Specified | No |
| Sheet Name | Name of the sheet in the Excel file to use. | Yes | `empty string` | Yes |
