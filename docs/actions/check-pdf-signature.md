This action checks if a PDF document contains an electronic signature by analyzing its structure. The result (True/False) is stored in a token for use in your workflow.

## `Typical Use Cases`

* Verify if a digitally signed contract or agreement is uploaded.
* Ensure only signed PDFs move forward in onboarding or compliance processes.
* Automate validation of user-submitted PDF documents before further processing.


## `Input Parameter Reference`

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                     | Supports Tokens | Default        | Required |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Source file       | Identifier for the source file. Can be RelativeUrl, AbsoluteUrl, LinkClickUrl, or PhysicalPath. Supports tokens.| Yes             | `empty string` | Yes      |

## `Output Parameters Reference`

| Parameter           | Description                                                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Output Token Name   | The token where the result (True or False) is stored as configured. |

## `Security`

**Ensure only trusted users and sources can specify the file to check.**  
Improper use of file paths or unsanitized input could potentially expose system files or sensitive information. Always validate and control where the file identifiers and output tokens originate.

## `How does this work?`

This action locates the provided PDF file and inspects it for electronic signature features using industry-standard PDF form fields. The result is stored in the output token you specify, making it easy to branch your workflow.

You must provide the Output Token Name parameterâ€”a token into which the action will write True (if the PDF is signed) or False (if not).

## `Examples`

### `1. Check if a user-uploaded PDF is signed`

Suppose users upload contracts via a form. After upload, you check if the file is signed and save the result in `[IsDocumentSigned]`.

```json
{
  "Title": "Check PDF Signature",
  "ActionType": "CheckPdfSignature",
  "Parameters": {
    "FileIdentifier": "[Form:ContractUpload]",
    "OutputTokenName": "IsDocumentSigned"
  }
}
```
Now, `[IsDocumentSigned]` contains `True` or `False`.

### `2. Use the signature check in a conditional workflow`

Check if an uploaded PDF is signed, and only send a confirmation email if it is.

```json
[
  {
    "Title": "Check PDF Signature",
    "ActionType": "CheckPdfSignature",
    "Parameters": {
      "FileIdentifier": "[Form:SignatureUpload]",
      "OutputTokenName": "IsSigned"
    }
  },
  {
    "Title": "Send Email",
    "ActionType": "SendEmail",
    "Condition": "[IsSigned]=True",
    "Parameters": {
      "To": "[User:Email]",
      "Subject": "Signed Contract Received",
      "Body": "Thank you for submitting a signed contract."
    }
  }
]
```

## FAQ

**What does "True" mean?**

When the result is `True`, it indicates the PDF contains the relevant signature flags (i.e., is electronically signed) according to PDF standards.

**Is this action compatible with all types of PDFs?**

This action works best with PDFs generated or signed using standard electronic signature tools. Some proprietary or unusual signature schemes may not be detected.

**If the action cannot read the PDF, what happens?**

If the file cannot be read or parsed, the output token is set to `False` and the workflow continues. Check logs for detailed error information if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Signed but returns False?**  
  Ensure the PDF uses standard signature fields. Some e-signature systems might use non-traditional methods.
- **File not found error:**  
  Double-check your file identifier and ensure the file exists in the expected location/context.
- **Large or encrypted files:**  
  Very large PDFs or encrypted files might not be processed successfully. Test with a standard, unencrypted file.
