This action will execute the specified actions for each item that belongs to the entity collection named in the `EntityName` parameter. To access field values from the currently iterated entity in the specified actions, use this token syntax:`[EntityName:EntityFieldName]`.

## `Typical Use Cases`

- Use the [Send Email](/docs/actions/send-email) action to send individual emails to a list of people in an entity.
- Use the [Run SQL Query](/docs/actions/run-sql) action to insert the records in an entity to a table in the database.

## `Don't use it to`

- Run actions on data not loaded into an entity. Just run the actions normally.
