Send a response back to a Twilio SMS webhook when you receive an SMS in their TwiML XML format. You can leave everything empty just to respond properly to Twilio Webhooks without sending a SMS back to the sender and not trigger an alarm in Twilio Debugger.

The status can be found in 'MessageStatus' property.Note that the redirect is unreachable if this URL is set. In this case, SMS session flow continues with the Twilio response to this URL request.Can contain My Tokens. | Yes | None |
| Use Redirect | For further instructions, you can redirect the response to a different TwiML document (It can be another API that uses this same action) for further processing. Using this way, you can chain multiple actions if needed, based on some SMS inputs. See more at their developer documentation. Note that the redirect is always put after the response message, so the SMS response is always sent, then the redirect occurs. | No | None |
