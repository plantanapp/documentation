## Discovering Plant an App

Plant an App is an extensive platform with continuously growing and evolving capabilities. Therefore, we offer various ways for you to discover what you can do with Plant an App and get familiar with our platform.

### <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/general/welcome" target="_blank">**Plant an App Documentation**</a>

ðŸ”— **<a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/general/welcome">learn.plantanapp.com</a>**

The central documentation portal provides a structured and searchable collection of information on all aspects of Plant an App, from installation and upgrades to actions and entities, to integrations with a wide range of third-party services e.g., Slack, Authorize.NET, Google, etc.

The Plant an App platform also includes extensive documentation within the development interface itself. Exploring the different actions and options available within a test environment is often the best way to discover what is available.

The [DNN Sharp legacy documentation portal](https://docs.dnnsharp.com/) can also be a viable source of information. Note however that this documentation is not maintained by our team. As such, many of the options and procedures have evolved since the move to Plant an App.

*Low Code Fundamentals* offers a structured introduction to the core features of the Plant an App environment through a self-paced online course. You can either work through the whole course or pick the specific sections most relevant to your implementation and requirements - the choice is yours.

The Low Code Fundamentals course is freely open and available to everyone - simply register on the <a href="https://academy.plantanapp.com">Plant an App Academy portal</a> or click on the `Getting Started` page button in your Plant an App configuration section.

## About The Plant an App Documentation Portal

Here you will find guides, information and details about how to use and configure Plant an App and make your low-code app building easy and enjoyable.

To help you navigate and easily find the information you need, the documentation sections mimic the `Configuration` menu design from your Plant an App instance - you will find them to the left of the screen.

Our product evolves constantly and so does our documentation. As we strive to provide you with the most detailed guides and relevant information for your Plant an App journey, you will notice that our Documentation structure and content changes from one version to the next in order to better reflect the platform's changes and improvements.

When you access the portal, you will always be presented with the documentation corresponding to the latest release of Plant an App: "`Current`".

To check the documentation for an older release, please select the desired version from the drop-down list located in the upper part of the screen.

If you need documentation for an older product version, please <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/important-notes/orientation-guide#getting-help" target="_blank">**contact us**</a>.

For an overview of what has been introduced, improved and fixed in each version, check the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/category/release-notes" target="_blank">`Release Notes`</a> section.
