# Overview of Licensing in Plant an App

Licensing in Plant an App controls how your organization accesses and builds on the platform. Understanding your license type is essential for compliance and to ensure you unlock all needed capabilities.

****

## `Licensing Types in Plant an App`

Plant an App offers a flexible and modular licensing model, suitable for organizations and agencies of all sizes, as well as independent developers.

### Main Licensing Components

- **Runtime Licensing**: Allows your application to run for end-users, and supports development based on the number of developer seats you have.
- **Developer Seat Licensing**: Controls the number of individual developers that can access building/configuring features at the same time. Seats are personal and tied to both the user and their device/browser. [Learn more about developer seats.](https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/updates/licensing/developer-seats)
- **Legacy Licensing**: A traditional model, still available, which may grant unlimited users, unlimited developer seats, or other features not offered in typical Runtime licenses.
- **MultiPortal Licensing**: An add-on for Enterprise that lets you use Plant an App modules across secondary portals/tenants within a hosting environment. [MultiPortal details](https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/updates/multiportal-licensing).

## `MultiPortal Licensing Overview`

MultiPortal Licensing enables Plant an App components (Forms, Listings, Search, Nav, etc.) to be licensed on additional/secondary portals inside a multi-tenant (multi-portal) environment. Typically, this capability is essential in large organizations or agencies managing several web properties on a single DNN (DotNetNuke) installation.

**Key Points:**
- Requires Plant an App Enterprise plan and Plant an App v1.24+ (on-premises).
- Requires available site licenses.
- Install the MultiPortal Licensing add-on and activate each secondary portal you wish to license.
- Once activated, you can build with Forms, Listings, and more on licensed portals.

## `How Developer Seats and Activation Work`

- Each seat is assigned to an individual and their device/browser (for concurrency limits and compliance).
- Accessing admin/configuration features prompts for seat activation.
- Seats may be transferred between devices, but only one device/browser combination per seat is active at a time.
- All plans except Legacy require at least one developer seat (Harvest/Enterprise plans allow more by purchase).

## `Best Practices & Considerations`

- **Match your plan** to your business scenarios (e.g., use MultiPortal for multi-tenant SaaS/agency scenarios).
- **Assign unique logins/seats** to each developer—no shared accounts or devices.
- **Manage activations actively**—deactivate unused seats before onboarding or device changes.
- **Review plan levels for your needed features** (backup, support, premium add-ons, user limits, etc.).
