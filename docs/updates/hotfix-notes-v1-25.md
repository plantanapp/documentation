## Instructions for Upgrading AppBuilder and Modules

`Please note that failure to follow these instructions may result in a broken instance of AppBuilder, and additional technical support may be required to resolve any issues that arise.`

`Backups of the file system and SQL Database are highly recommended before proceeding.`

### Users on AppBuilder (AB) version 1.25.99 or Lower
- **Verify your current AB version**: Before attempting to upgrade, identify your current version of AppBuilder.
- **Manually upgrade to AB 5.25.102 or higher**: If you're on AB 1.25.99, you must manually download and install at least AB 5.25.102 to move past the AB 1.25.100 version barrier.  Contact [support](https://console.plantanapp.com/Support) for to request the download and for instructions on how to install it.
- **Install the latest AppBuilder hotfix**: After upgrading past AB 1.25.100, make sure to further update to the latest available hotfix.

### Users on AppBuilder Versions Between AB 1.25.105 and AB 1.25.143
- **Bulk install recommended**: If your version falls within this range, you're safe to proceed with a bulk installation of all the latest hotfixes, which should handle the necessary upgrades in the correct order.
- **Avoid individual module installation**: Do not install modules individually before ensuring AppBuilder is upgraded to the required version of AB 1.25.164 or higher.

### Users on AppBuilder Version AB 1.25.143 or Lower Desiring Individual Module Upgrades
- **Upgrade AppBuilder first**: Prioritize updating AppBuilder to version AB 1.25.164 or higher before installing individual modules.
- **Check module requirements**: Refer to the change notes for each module to confirm the minimum AppBuilder version required.
- **Update modules after AppBuilder**: Once AppBuilder is at the correct version, proceed with individual module upgrades as desired.
