This page details the usage of the **MultiPortal licensing add-on** that allows you to use Plant an App modules on secondary portals.

## What is "MultiPortal licensing"?

Through this add-on, users can now license additional portals in environments in which multiple portals/tenants are available. After licensing the portal with the "PlantAnApp MultiPortal Licensing", features such as the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/category/form" target="_blank">`Forms`</a>, `Listings`, `Search` and `Nav` modules can be used on secondary portals.

### Prerequisites

- Plant an App version 1.24 and above (on-prem installation)
- A Plant an App enterprise license
- Available site licenses

### Installation

To use the multi-portal licensing feature you must install a special licensing add-on. You can find it under `Configuration` > `Updates` > `Add-ons`.

Search for 'Multi' and you will find "PlantAnApp MultiPortal Licensing".

Install this add-on and wait for the site to come back online. Then, please follow the steps below *for each portal* on which you will use Plant an App components: 

1. Create a new page anywhere on the site. You can call it anything, but 'Plant an App License' makes sense. It can be a hidden page and permissions do not matter.

2. Put the page in "Edit" mode by clicking on the ✎ (pencil icon) in the bottom left side of the screen, and then on the "Add Module" button.

3. Select and add the "**PlantAnApp MultiPortal Licensing**" module anywhere on the page (you may need to search for 'Multi' in the "Add Module").

4. Once it is added to the page, click the "`Activate`" button that appears in the module. You will be redirected to: `console.plantanapp.com`.

5. Login into the console with your Plant an App credentials.

6. Once the page loads, click the "`Activate`" button.

7. You will then be redirected back to your portal page, which will now say: "**Portal successfully licensed!**"

That's it! You can now use Plant an App Components on the site.
